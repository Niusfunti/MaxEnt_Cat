# MaxEnt-based modelling of spatial-temporal patterns of migratory birds in Catalonia during the prenuptial period

Abstract

Most birds in the northern hemisphere feed on seeds, fruits and insects. During the winter, all their food is covered with snow or disappears. For this reason, birds migrate to other places close to food. This migration phenomenon is crucial because migratory birds are indicators of ecosystem health, biodiversity and climate change. This paper describes a framework for modelling spatiotemporal patterns of migratory birds in Catalonia during the prenuptial period based on MaxEnt. The probability of observation of four bird species that can be seen in Catalonia during the prenuptial months has been predicted monthly, with AUC values ranging from 0.746 to 0.955. Finally, a GitHub repository with the proposed implementation is provided.
